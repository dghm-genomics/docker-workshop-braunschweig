## What is Linux?

Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system that runs on many different platforms. Most distributions (i.e. packaged versions) are available for free and are open source. 

## What is the console?

You are working with the console right now - the console provides a way for the computer to send text output to the user, and to receive text input from the user. The user typically enters text with a computer keyboard and reads the output text on a computer monitor.
